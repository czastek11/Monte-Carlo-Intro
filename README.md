# Monte-Carlo-Intro

Theses are introductionary models for monte carlo simulation.

1. Sailor(Drunkard) model
Description for graph and results: The graph above shows the dependence on a logarithmic scale of the standard deviation of sigma position on the number of simulated steps . In the simulation, these values were counted for N from 10 to 10000. The number of sailors in the simulation is 250. The graph also estimates the exponent using linear regression.
Slope meaning slope corresponds to the value of a in Eq. Straight y=ax+b. It is 0.49983Â±0.0005126 or approximately 0.5 , as we assumed in the theory of this task
