# Monte-Carlo-Intro

Theses are introductionary models for monte carlo simulation.

1. Sailor(Drunkard) model
Description for graph and results: The graph above shows the dependence on a logarithmic scale of the standard deviation of sigma position on the number of simulated steps . In the simulation, these values were counted for N from 10 to 10000. The number of sailors in the simulation is 250. The graph also estimates the exponent using linear regression.
Slope meaning slope corresponds to the value of a in Eq. Straight y=ax+b. It is 0.49983Â±0.0005126 or approximately 0.5 , as we assumed in the theory of this task

2. Diffusion of N atoms in 2D
  Description for graph and results: The graph above shows a plot of the dependence of the diffusion coefficient D on the number of MCS steps - K (system transitions). It can be seen that the coefficient D is higher for very small K~(0.3) , which quickly decreases and for the rest of K oscillates around a constant value.
These results were developed from simulations based on the following code. The number of independent realizations for each K is 30 , while the density of the layout C=0.5 . The size of the system is 20x20 sites , and the number of atoms simulated is 200.
